If you wish to use the recorder, do so at your own risk or sign up for your own doodstream api key. It ends back iframes and download links which is handy and can be another revenue stream.

No payment gateways are integrated but that's easy enough to do, I can get you set up for a reasonable fee if you need help. Now, go show the world your behinds!
